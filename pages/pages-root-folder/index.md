Welcome to my quiet little corner of the internet. I'm an engineer working primarily with medical device research and development. I'm currently exploring the application of control systems theory to improve heart and lung organ preservation technology with a great group of researchers and clinicians in Lund, Sweden. After graduating as an Electrical Engineer from the University of British Columbia in 2017, I moved to Kathmandu, Nepal, where I spent a year starting a programming and electronics club for students aged 10 - 16. To read more about that, hop on over to my [blog][1], or try starting a similar initiative using the [open-source teaching materials I developed][2]. To see a bit about my current research, head over [here][3].
