Hi, I'm an engineer working primarily with the design and production of medical devices. After spending nearly two years working on heart and lung organ preservation technology in Sweden, I returned to the University of British Columbia to finish my degree in Electrical Engineering. In August 2017 I moved to Kathmandu, Nepal, where I am teaching programming and electronics to school children for one year. Follow what I'm up to on my [blog][1].
