Thursday, August 3rd, was my first day at [Shree Mangal Dvip school][1] (SMD). After a good night's sleep following 36 hours of travel, I was met at my guest-house by Tashi, a recent graduate of Class 10 at SMD. As we walked to the school, Tashi explained that he has been independently learning and experimenting with electronics since a young age. Now that he is a senior student working as a director's-assistant at SMD, he has also been thinking about running electronics activities with the students.

The school is much as I remember it from 7 years ago. The kids run, laugh, and glow with enthusiasm; they are motivated and articulate. The staff and senior students do a great job running the school, and their dedication shows in the health and happiness of the students. Meals are served three times per day, and they are absolutely delicious!

Many of the students are surprised to hear that I will be working at the school for a whole 10 months, and ask what it is I will be doing. Much to my delight, many students from a wide range of grades have expressed excitement when I explain that I will be running hands-on activities to introduce programming and electronics concepts.
