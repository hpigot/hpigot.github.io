Activity 9 was the first in a series of activities, in which the students work toward building their own small flashlight/night-light. The objective is to give the students an opportunity to put their new soldering skills to use to build something they can keep at the end of the activity.  So far, each activity has been self-contained, and the students' work has to be disassembled at the end of the session. With soldering, the circuits built are permanent, so it's a great opportunity to build something useful! That circuit is a light both as a flashlight and as a night-light that turns on when the room becomes dark. This past weekend, the students used a [breadboard][] to build the first iteration of this night-light circuit and explored some of it's drawbacks, which lead us into the coming week's activity.

The circuit uses an inexpensive sensor that changes resistance depending on the ambient light. Using this sensor in a voltage divider configuration allows it to be used to turn off an LED when the surroundings are bright, and switch it off in the dark. However, the students noticed that the LED is much dimmer than usual. They were able to recognize that the brightness is reduced because the current must flow through extra resistance in the voltage divider. If only there were some kind of electronic switch that we could control with the voltage divider, instead of connecting the LED directly to it! In the next activity, we will be improving the circuit by adding exactly that, a transistor.
