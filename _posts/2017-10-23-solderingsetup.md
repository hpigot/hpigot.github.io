I recently setup 10 soldering stations to use with the students of the [Himalayan Makers Guild](/nepal/clubsetup) in an [introductory soldering activity](/nepal/activity8). Purchasing soldering equipment here in Nepal had its advantages and disadvantages. On one hand, it was 1/4 of the cost it would have been if I'd purchased the parts from Amazon, but a sacrifice was made in the quality of the tools. A detailed parts list and price comparison between buying in Kathmandu or online from AliExpress or Amazon is provided in this [spreadsheet][] (or as [.xlsx][xlsx])gr along with supplier links.

The following items should be considered when setting up multiple soldering stations:

*	**At bare minimum,**
	*	Soldering iron
	*	Solder with a flux core
	*	Safety glasses
	*	Multi-plug extension cord
*	**After that, the highest priority items are**
	*	Brass solder sponge, to clean the soldering iron tip
	*	Solder flux, to help the solder flow (1 shared between two stations)
	*	Soldering iron stand, for safety and convenience
*	**Related tools and nice to have items include**
	*	Desoldering pump (1 shared between two stations)
	*	Extra soldering iron tips
	*	Flush cutters (1 shared between two stations)
	*	Wire strippers (1 shared between two stations)

_Two complete soldering stations. They share solder flux, wire strippers, and flush cutters. One solder sucker could also be shared between two stations. Each station includes a soldering iron, stand, sponge, solder, and safety glasses._ 

If I were to setup the soldering stations again, there are a couple of things things I would do differently. I would spend a bit more money to purchase [soldering irons][aa-iron] that have a power-indicator light and basic temperature control. The power here cuts out, and connections can be spotty, so having the indicator light would help the students understand if their iron is working properly. I would also purchase [brass sponges][aa-sponge] rather than wet sponges for cleaning the irons; they are more effective and last longer.
