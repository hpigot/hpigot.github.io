On Saturday November 15th the students learned how to adjust the [Night-Light circuit][activity10] to use a small 3.3V coin-cell battery, rather than the 5V power supply we've been using to prototype the circuit on the [breadboard][]. To do this, the students were introduced to Ohm's Law. The law relates current, voltage, and resistance, formalizing what the students have until now understood through a [rock-slide analogy][activity1] of electricity:

To keep the Night-Light LED at full brightness, the students calculated the new resistor value to use with the 3.3V coin-cell battery, and tested it out on the breadboard to see if it worked as they expected. To select this new resistor, the students also learned how to read the colour-codes of resistors.

13 boys and 21 girls attended the activity (37%:63%)[^1]. One set of parts cost $7.66 CAD, and 10 sets were used by 38 club members, bringing the cost per student down to $2.01 CAD[^2].
