On Saturday November 11th the students learned how to adjust the [night-light circuit][activity10] to use a small 3.3V coin-cell battery, rather than the 5V power supply we've been using to prototype the circuit on [breadboards][]. To do this, the students were introduced to Ohm's Law. The law relates current, voltage, and resistance, formalizing what the students have until now understood through a [rock-slide analogy][activity1] of electricity:

To keep the night-light LED at full brightness, the students calculated the a resistor value to use with the coin-cell battery and tested it out on the breadboard. To select this new resistor, the students also learned how to read the colour-codes of resistors.

14 boys and 24 girls attended the activity (37%:63%)[^1]. One set of parts cost $7.66 CAD, and 10 sets were used by 38 club members, bringing the cost per student down to $2.01 CAD[^2].
