In 2010, I visited [Shree Mangal Dvip Boarding School](https://www.himalayanchildren.org/) in Kathmandu, Nepal. SMD provides a home and education to children from remote Himilayan communities, as well as local monks and day students. The school focuses on preserving the Tibetan language and culture of the region. I was awe-struck by the joy and vivacity of the children there, as well as the dedication of the people working at the school. The school encourages capable and motivated senior students to pursue full scholarships abroad for grades 11 and 12, as well as university; in doing so, the students sign an agreement with the school's founder to return and give service in their home villages or SMD.

I have now graduated from university and it's an ideal time to work with the school for a year. Having studied electrical engineering at the University of British Columbia, I've developed a passion for programming, electronics, and the hands-on creative mentality of the "maker" and DIY community. My goal is to bring these interests together and introduce them to the students of SMD through activities and workshops focusing on digital literacy. Prior to my departure at the beginning of August 2017, I have been taking the following steps in preparation:

*	Write a short proposal
*	Make contacts at UBC and in Kathmandu
*	Gather teaching materials resources
*	Purchase parts and tools

I wrote a short proposal to gather feedback and lay-out a budget for communicating with potential supporters. After months of consideration, writing the proposal helped solidify my intentions and the types of resources that I would need to offer hands-on activities at SMD. I sent the proposal to family and friends, as well as contacts at UBC and the [Maker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maker_culture)/[STEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science,_technology,_engineering,_and_mathematics) community in Kathmandu. The proposal is a living document, and I hope to keep it updated as the project solidifies and adapts to the reality of the situation in Kathmandu. It is available here: [github]().

I contacted friends at UBC who are involved with excellent STEM outreach programs, offering similar activites to those I hope to run. [Geering Up](http://www.geeringup.apsc.ubc.ca/about/) and [engcite](http://engcite.engineering.ubc.ca/) agreed to share their teaching resources as well as their advice on teaching STEM to grade-school children. In additionally I found a few other potentially useful resources. There is no shortage of lesson material out there. The challenge will be to choose age and context appropriate lessons, and to string them together in a way that fits the time available.

I also contacted members of my faculty, in the hopes of finding financing to purchase parts and tools for the activities. I am very greatful to Dean Marc Parlange and Associate Dean Elizabeth Croft for agreeing to meet to discuss the proposal and providing a generous sponsorship to help fund the project.

A key part of what I hope to do at SMD is to connect the school to the existing electronics and programming community in Kathmandu. I was pleased to find that Kathmandu seems to have a rich Maker community, and a lot of activity surrounding the engineering schools there. I reached out to the following groups, and arranged to meet with them during my first two weeks in Kathmandu to learn more about their work and discuss potential collaboration.

*	[Innovation Hub Kathmandu](http://fncci.org/innovation-hub-159.html)

Another critical step in preparation for leaving for Nepal was to purchase componenets and tools that will be used in the activities. The postal service is unreliable in Nepal, and I wanted to take advantage of ordering inexpensive parts directly from China, or reputable sellers here in Canada. Everything will be brought in my carry-on luggage. Not having a clear idea of what activities I will run, I decided to purchase a broad range of general components that will enable activities using Arduino microcontrollers and Raspberry Pi single board computers. Both are tools specifically designed for education and have strong online communities. Geering Up recommended 5-10 students for a single instructor, so I chose to purchase quantities to accomodate these number. Components that are easily broken, lost, or very inexpensive in quantity were bought in higher numbers (i.e. resistors, LEDs, buttons).

I'd like to thank my family and friends - in particular Kristian, Rohit, and Edwin - for encouraging and supporting this initiative. Also, thank you to the University of British Columbia Faculty of Applied Science for their generous sponsorship that will help in purchasing the materials and tools for the activities.
