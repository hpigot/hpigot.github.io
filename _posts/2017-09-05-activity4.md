After a week's break for midterm exams, our activities have resumed! This week we constructed a simple motor-control circuit to introduce the concept of analog electronics. Unfortunately, many students were away for the long-weekend after exams, so only a few of our usual participants were present. The up-side was that we could combine our 4 sessions into 2 longer sessions, and the students made great use of the extra time exploring the activity's open challenges. 

This week we also started the formalizing the club and it's membership. So far, the activities have been open to anyone from Grade 4 to 9. We're now defining a group of members who are committed to attending every activity so we can better organize and build upon the concepts we're exploring. Every two months, we will on-board new members, and have student leaders in the club teach them the first few activities so they have the same fundamentals as existing members. The participants also voted on potential club names and decided on the Himalayan Makers Guild! Members are given folders as a sort of club membership card to keep their activity handouts in.
