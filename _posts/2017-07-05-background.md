In 2010, I visited [Shree Mangal Dvip Boarding School](https://www.himalayanchildren.org/) in Kathmandu, Nepal. SMD provides a home and education to children from remote Himalayan communities, as well as local monks and day students. The school focuses on preserving the Tibetan language and culture of the region. I was awe-struck by the joy and vivacity of the children there, as well as the dedication of the people working at the school. The school encourages capable and motivated senior students to pursue full scholarships abroad for grades 11 and 12, as well as university; in doing so, the students sign an agreement with the school's founder to return and give service in their home villages or SMD.

I have now graduated from university and it's an ideal time to work with the school for a year. Having studied electrical engineering at the University of British Columbia, I've developed a passion for programming, electronics, and the hands-on creative mentality of the "maker" and DIY community. My goal is to bring these interests together and introduce them to the students of SMD through activities and workshops focusing on digital literacy. Prior to my departure at the beginning of August 2017, I have been taking the following steps in preparation:

*	Write a short proposal
*	Make contacts at UBC and in Kathmandu
*	Gather teaching materials resources
*	Purchase parts and tools

I'd like to thank my family and friends - in particular Kristian, Rohit, and Edwin - for encouraging and supporting this initiative. Also, thank you to the University of British Columbia Faculty of Applied Science for their generous sponsorship that will help in purchasing the materials and tools for the activities.
