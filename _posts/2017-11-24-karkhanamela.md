In October, Tashi and I took the HMG [Team Leaders][] on a field-trip to the [Karkhana Mela][mela] open house. [Karkhana][] is an innovative education company working to spread Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Math ([STEAM][]) to students throughout Nepal. They conduct activities similar to what we do in the [Himalayan Makers Guild][HMG], and have been both mentors and a helpful resource since I met them in August. I would've liked to have taken all 60 HMG team members, but it wasn't practical to transport everyone. In lieu of that, I asked the team leaders to make note of the things they observed and found interesting, and they gave a short presentation to their group during [Activity 8][].

It was delightful to see the students take interest in all of the different displays, from drones and laser cutters to scribbling robots and banana pianos. They were wide-eyed and inquisitive, asking some great questions and jotting down their observations.

A big "thank-you" to [Karkhana][] for putting on the event!
