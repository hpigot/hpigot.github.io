Three months ago, I transferred responsibility for the Himalayan Makers Guild entirely to the students of the club. Since then, the activities of the club have continued under their leadership. They are using a hands-on, peer-to-peer model to learn electronics and programming among the club's 50 students aged 10 to 16. In May and June, I was still on-site to support the students through the transition. Now, after leaving Nepal at the end of June, they have been running things independently for [over one month][Facebook page].

During my last 5 months with in Kathmandu, I focused on restructuring the club for long-term viability, in the hopes of making HMG completely self-sustaining and capable nurturing the body of knowledge already present among the club's members.

## 1.	Initial Structure

During our first 7 months of operation (September 2017 until students started exams in March 2018), we did a new activity in the club every weekend, with the members split into 4 groups to keep the class sizes down and accommodate our limited activity materials (~10-15 sets of parts). This approach had a few problems:

*	**New Activity Every Week:** It was time consuming to plan a new activity every week and document it well for future use. If the club were to continue as a student led entity, we could not expect them to spend each week developing one activity.
*	**No Continuity:** The structure did not facilitate continuity between activities, since each one was thought up on its own with little long-term vision for the progression of the activities. Tashi and I were essentially flying by the seats of our pants. Also we did not have the scope to make use of an engineering design cycle to look at bigger and more interesting challenges.
*	**Circuit Disassembly:** After each class the students needed to disassemble anything they'd to make the materials available for the next group or next week's activity.
*	**Training New Members:** New members needed extensive training so they could participate in the latest activities without feeling lost (see the [November 2017 recruitment process](/nepal/recruitment1)).

In the initial structure, the head of the club was responsible for developing the activities, training the student leaders, then leading the activity with all the club members. With this approach, the student leaders did not have the opportunity to lead the activities independently; everything depended on the Club Head, making the longevity of the club dependent on leaders who could take on all that responsibility.

With the support of our amazing first group of student leaders this system took us through our first 7 months of growth and allowed for a lot of experimentation and discussion on how to better run the club. However, with it's top-heavy organization, it was not a structure that encouraged long-term sustainability on the basis of student leadership.
_for more details on the original club structure see [Club Setup]()_

## 2. New Structure

1.  The club activities are now scheduled into semesters
2.  The members are divided into one of three groups each semester which they progress through sequentially
3.  All new members do the same core acivities in their first semester, so they all have the same foundation of concepts
4.  Activities are now taught by student leaders

Looking at the club from a yearly perspective, we chose to schedule the club activities in 6-month semesters.Each semester culminates in an exhibition where the club members present what they've built and learned to their peers and teachers at the school. The schedule for a typical school year looks like this:

![semesters](/images/clubstructure/semesters.png)
_April is the school's year-end break, and 6 months have been allocated to Semester 2 due to winter holiday time and exams in March._

The club members are split into three different groups. New members spend one semester learning core concepts, while more experienced members participate in one of two project groups where they work with 2-3 other students to build a solution to a specific problem. These project groups allow the students to apply their knowledge, build something unique, and learn about the [engineering design cycle]().

![group icons](/images/clubstructure/group_icons.png)

1.	Foundation: Each semester, newly recruited members work together to learn fundamental electronics and programming concepts in the Foundation group. These activities are revised and reorganization versions of those created during the first 7 months of the club's operation, taking into account all the mistakes and successes made along the way.
2.	Car Project: After a semester in the Foundation group, members build on their existing knowledge to create an Arduino-based self-driving car.
3.	Solar Project: Members graduating from the Car Project learn more challenging electronics concepts to build a compete photovoltaic system, starting with a small solar-powered light then moving on to create solar-powered system of their own design.

With guidance and training from the Club Head, all of the activities are now taught by students in those groups - the Group Leaders. Currently, with group sizes of 10-15 students, there are 4 leaders in each group. Within the Foundation group, two of the leaders are experienced club members who have already done the Foundation activities once before. The other two leaders are from the newly recruited members, giving them the chance to learn how to lead the group from their more experienced peers.

![group leaders](/images/clubstructure/leader_numbers.png)

There are two key changes to this new leadership structure:

1.	The Club Head is not responsible for teaching all the activities. Instead, they focus on training the leaders and managing the club from a broader perspective.
2.	The activity material is mostly pre-set, and the remaining lesson planning is done collaboratively with the Group Leaders.

![new structure](/images/clubstructure/new1.png)

_Group Leaders guiding activities._

Each week, the club activities are divided into 2 parts for each group: a training meeting where the Group Leaders and Club Head prepare for the week's activity, then each group's activity in which the Group Leaders guide their peers. When training the Foundation Group Leaders, the Club Head conducts the week's activity with them using the lesson plan and student handout for the activity. The leaders then use those same documents to support their instruction of the group. All 12 Foundation Activities have been carefully documented to make instruction easier for the leaders. Furthermore, some of the leaders will have already done the activity before revisiting it with the Club Head which gives them an extra bit of confidence when leading their peers.

The activity of each project group over the course of the semester are guided by a "Project Definition and Overview" document. The documents contain:

1.	Problem background and definition
2.	Needs and constraints of the solution the students will build
3.	Materials and costs
4.	Design challenges - recommendation on how the students can improve their design after building the first prototype
5.	6 month plan
6.	Resources for building the demonstration prototype
7.	Teaching resources for topic activities that introduce necessary electronics and programming concepts

The Club Head helps the Project Group Leaders make use of these documents and stay on schedule as they move through the 6 month plan. The Club Head and leaders work together to plan activities relating to the project, with the help of the resources outlined in the documents. As a graduate of the club, the projects will already be familiar to the Club Head.

![training docs](/images/clubstructure/activity_docs.png)

## 3. Selecting New Leaders

Each year, a total of four newly recruited members become Foundation Group Leaders. Ideally they will then choose to take on leadership roles when they graduate into the Car Project group during their 2nd semester. These new leaders help offset the Group Leaders who leave the club after graduating from the school (grade 10), or who choose to resign from their leadership role.

![leader turnover](/images/clubstructure/leader_turnover.png)

Group Leaders are selected by the Club Head and existing Group Leaders. New Group Leaders who have just joined HMG for their first semester are chosen based on their interest in the role, understanding of its expectations, and any relevant previous experience. Members who become group leaders after their first semester in the club (Experienced Group Leaders) are chosen according to the commitment they've shown to HMG (attendance, in-class participation) and their understanding of electronics and programming as observed by the leaders and Club Head during activities.

Each year one HMG member graduating from grade 10 will have the opportunity to become the Club Head. The Club Head will be selected by the existing and previous club heads with input from the Group Leaders, typically from among the members with experience as Group Leaders. In addition to training the Group Leaders, the Club Head is responsible for administration of the entire club - purchasing materials, organizing, and coordinating. Students are able to take on this role full-time at [SMD school](), where HMG is based, due to the "Seniors Program" in which graduated students give one year of service back to their school. After one year the Club Head will pass on the role to the next person, but continue to act as an advisor to the new Club Head. The new Club Head will work closely with the previous Club Head during their first month (May) to understand the role.

An overview of HMG leadership roles:

|  | New Group Leader | Experienced Group Leader | Club Head |
|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **What are they responsible for?** | Teaching the Foundation Activities (following the lesson plans)   | Teaching one of the three groups; following the project outlines; making lesson plans with the Club Head | Training the leaders; organizing the club and its resources; making new activities/projects |
| **How many?** | 2 people   | 10 people | 1 person |
| **Who can become one?** | Any new member.   | New Leaders; members who have shown exceptional commitment to HMG. | Experienced Club Leaders who have become senior students. |
| **How much extra time does it take?** | 1.5 hours/week   | 1.5 hours/week | full time |

Being a leader in the club takes extra time and effort. Still, students are motivated to take on the responsibility because it gives them the opportunity to learn the concepts in more depth, spend more time hands-on with electronics and programming, and expand their skill-set as student leaders. Also, they understand that the success of the club is dependent on its student leaders and it is up to them whether or not the club will stay active. From the start, the structure of the club encourages them to take on these roles, positioning their own peers as mentors and role-models.

## 4. Future Growth - The Open Project Group

The most experienced members of the club - those who have completed 3 semesters, including the Foundation Activities and both projects - will have the opportunity to join a fourth group, the Open Project Group. The group will be a platform for these members to explore new challenges in a more self-directed manner, with the support of the Club Head, for multiple semesters until they finish grade  10. If a student joins the club in the first semester of 2018 as they enter grade 5, they will have the option of joining the Open Project Group during their 2nd semester in 2019, as a grade 6 student.

![typical timeline](/images/clubstructure/timeline.png)

Students will work together in groups of 3-4 and select a project to work on for the semester based on their interests and challenges facing their community. As they define and work through these projects, they will be prototyping projects that may be suitable for the entire club to participate in. With some additional documentation and support from the Club Head, their projects could become a recurring project alongside the Car and Solar projects.

There will be no specific leaders within the Open Project Group. As the most advanced group of students in the club, they will guide themselves and communicate directly with the Club Head. In turn, the Club Head will ensure they are on-track to complete a project within the 6 month semester, and that they have the resources they need to be successful.

## 5. My Hopes for the Himalayan Makers Guild

As I write this, the club has been running independently for one month. I am now back in Sweden, and Tashi Choeden and the Group Leaders continue to run HMG's weekly activites (see our [Facebook page]() for their latest updates). The last 6 months have been a steady transition to this point, with Tashi and the students taking on more responsibility each week, learning quickly and growing as leaders among their peers.

![tashi training leaders](/images/clubstructure/tashi1.jpg)

Before I left [SMD school]() all of the club members came together to give their thanks to the students who have led the club over the past year, and hear a bit about this new club structure and the role they will play to continue to make HMG a reality.

It has been an honor to work with these kids. I am inspired by their enthusiasm, intelligence, and independence. By giving me the opportunity to teach and organize HMG, they helped build my confidence and taught me about engineering education and student leadership. My hope for HMG is that it will continue to provide an opportunity for students to gain exposure to electronics and programming as tools to create, experiment, enjoy, and  employ to solve problems that matter.

The club has the foundation and structure to maintain and develop the knowledge-base already held by it's members. I hope that the students will train their peers as new leaders, and together they will keep the club running for years to come. The students have the motivation, ability, and resources to make it happen.
