When I started doing hands-on electronics and programming activities with the students at [Shree Mangal Dvip Boarding School][SMD] (SMD) in August, my strategy was to just get _something_ started and make adjustments as I went along. We began by making a simple [LED light circuit][activity1]. The activities were open to anyone in grades 4-9 who was interested in attending. I chose to run the activities on Saturday, when the students have free time, in an available classroom or in the computer lab if necessary. In the first few weeks attendance fluctuated between 20 and 75 students, and we split the students up into four 1-hour sessions to accommodate those numbers. The limitations of completely open attendance quickly became clear. Irregular attendance would limit the complexity of the topics we could explore, cause unequal distribution of class size between the four sessions, and make it difficult to prepare the right amount of materials.

Since then, Tashi Choeden and I have made changes to the structure and presentation of the student club that I'm very excited about. Formalizing the activities under the banner of a "school club" gave us a platform to rally the students around and help build student ownership of the initiative. This involved three parts: club identity, defining membership, and establishing student leaders. We needed to choose a club name and logo that the students would be proud of. In terms of membership, we wanted to focus the club around students who showed interest and would commit to participating every week. Selecting and training student leaders was an important step for both the day-to-day operation of the club and its sustainability.

### Building a Club Identity

Tashi Choeden and I discussed a few possible names for the club, and had the students vote on which one they liked the most. They chose to name the club the **Himalayan Makers Guild**.

* Most of the boarding students at [SMD][] come from remote villages in the [Himalayas][]
* A [maker][] is someone with a passion for creating new things, learning, and sharing
* [Guilds][oldguild] were traditionally associations of artisans or tradesmen, and in modern gaming culture a [guild][gamingguild] is a group of people with common goals or interests

_The results of our club-name poll. 69 students voted._

After choosing the name, we set out to design a logo for the club. We wanted to incorporate imagery related to programming or electronics together with something representative of the school. We chose to use a shape similar to the [logo of the Kagyu Monlam][karmapalogo]—a common symbol for the Karma Kagyu lineage of Tibetan Buddhism practiced at [SMD][]—and drew it in the style of a printed-circuit-board trace. In the interest of time, we paid $21 USD to have it drawn-up and revised through an online service called [fiverr][].

### Defining Club Membership

Grade 4 seemed to be a good lower-bound in terms of maturity and English language ability, and the eldest students (grade 10) are asked to focus solely on their studies, making grade 9 the upper bound. 

* Focus on sustainability
* Asked the members to sign that they agree with the following [Membership Expectations](/files/2017 HMG Membership Agreement.docx)
  1.  Attend every activity, or notify a club leader 1 day in advance if you will be absent
  2.  Do any tasks that are assigned as homework
  3.  Arrive on time to your assigned session
  4.  Present your ideas to the group in English
  5.  Be respectful of the ideas and opinions of others
* Expectations: We've clarified that if student's miss 2 classes without telling us in advance (one of the membership expectations), they'll be given one more chance to show their commitment to the club. If they don't take that chance, they'll be out of the club and can reapply again 2 months later during the next on-boarding. We expect the membership to stabilize 
* Folders given to members for them to keep their activity handouts in

### Selecting and Training Student Leaders

1.	Take attendance, help organize students, and help answer student questions
2.	Participate in weekly advance training, to preview the activity for the weekend, give feedback, and ask questions. This will be for 1 hour, most likely on Thursday at 7pm right after dinner.
3.	Be involved in planning the future of the club and its activities, including helping with management and administration.

*	Special focus on younger kids in the groups
*	Thursday 7pm meetings to review activity
*	Primary job is to represent all members of the club
*	Examples: uphold the membership expectations
*	Openness about money: where does it come from and what will we do in the future?
*	Openness in general: free to communicate with the other members.
*	Answering peoples questions: help them find the answers!
*	What would you want to see on the student handout?

### Initial Survey

*	Give a starting point for evaluation of the learning outcomes (not just material, but also how interested the students are in the topics and the way they're using technology )
*	Used [Nesta 2015 Young Digital Makers Survey][nesta] as a reference


### Issues to Address Moving Forward

*	Editing and updating lessons (limited PC access, mix with hard copy revisions?)
*	Managing finances (who, how)
*	On-boarding, Team Leaders transitions (in/out), Board of Directors?

On August 21, we had students vote on 5 possible names for our STEM group. From this, we adopted Himalayan Makers Guild as the official title for the student club.
