When I started doing hands-on electronics and programming activities with the students at [Shree Mangal Dvip Boarding School][SMD] (SMD) in August, my strategy was to just get _something_ started and make adjustments as I went along. Together with Tashi Choeden, I began by making a simple [LED light circuit][activity1] with the students. We chose to run the activities on Saturday during the students' free time. In the first few weeks attendance fluctuated between 20 and 75 students, and we split the students up into four 1-hour sessions to accommodate those numbers. The limitations of completely open attendance quickly became clear. Irregular attendance would limit the complexity of the topics we could explore, cause unequal distribution of class size between the four sessions, and make it difficult to prepare the right amount of materials.

Since then, we've formalized the activities under the banner of a "school club" which gives us a platform to rally the students around and help build their ownership of the initiative. This involved three parts: 

1.  Club identity: choose a club name and logo that the students would be proud of.
2.  Membership: focus the club around students who showed interest and would commit to participating every week.
3.  Student leaders: select and train student leaders to help with both the day-to-day operation of the club and its sustainability.

### Building a Club Identity

Tashi Choeden and I discussed a few possible names for the club, and the students voted on which one they liked the most. They chose to name the club the **Himalayan Makers Guild**.

* **H**:  Most of the boarding students at [SMD][] come from remote villages in the [Himalayas][]
* **M**:  A [maker][] is someone with a passion for creating new things, learning, and sharing
* **G**:  [Guilds][oldguild] were traditionally associations of artisans or tradesmen, and in modern gaming culture a [guild][gamingguild] is a group of people with common goals or interests

After choosing the name, we set out to design a logo for the club. We wanted to incorporate imagery related to programming or electronics together with something representative of the school. We chose to use a shape similar to the [logo of the Kagyu Monlam][karmapalogo]—a common symbol for the Karma Kagyu lineage of Tibetan Buddhism practiced at [SMD][]—and drew it in the style of a printed-circuit-board trace. In the interest of time, we paid $21 USD to have it drawn-up and revised on [fiverr][], an online service marketplace.

### Defining Club Membership

We opened membership to all students from grades 4-9. Grade 4 seemed to be a good lower-bound in terms of maturity and English language ability, and the eldest students (grade 10) are asked to focus solely on their studies, making grade 9 the upper bound. We defined five membership expectations:

  1.  Attend every activity, or notify a club leader 1 day in advance if you will be absent
  2.  Do any tasks that are assigned as homework
  3.  Arrive on time to your assigned session
  4.  Present your ideas to the group in English
  5.  Be respectful of the ideas and opinions of others

All 63 club members signed and dated their [agreement][] to these expectations. The consequence of breaking the agreement was made clear: members have two strikes, then they'll be given one more chance to show their commitment to the club by performing some task of our choosing. If they choose not to do that task, they forfeit their membership and can reapply during the next on-boarding (every two months). The goal of these expectations is to ensure the students' commitment and give them the sense of becoming a part of something official. To that end, we also gave each member a Himalayan Makers Guild folder to act as a sort of membership card where they could keep their activity handouts.

### Selecting and Training Student Leaders

Club sustainability has been a focus since day one. Carefully documenting the activities is one facet of this ongoing effort. However the most important factor for the future of the Himalayan Makers Guild will be student leadership here at the school. We decided to create leadership positions that would involve extra responsibility in organizing and running the club, as well as early training in the activities to enable the leaders to give feedback, ask  questions, and be well equipped to help their peers during the Saturday sessions. The day after the students signed their membership agreements, we opened applications for Team Leader positions. We defined three additional expectations for them, beyond those of normal club members:

1.  Take attendance, help organize students, and help answer student questions.
2.  Participate in a weekly activity preview and training; give feedback on the activity and ask questions.
3.  Be involved in planning the future of the club and its activities, including helping with management and administration.

The positions were open to all club members, and we asked them to answer two questions in the [application form](/files/2017 HMG Team Leader Application.pdf):

1. In your own words, what is the goal of the Himalayan Makers Guild, and how can you help reach that goal as a Team Leader?
2. What are your strengths that will help you be a good Team Leader?

We considered their responses to the application questions lightly; they were really intended to limit applicants to those students who were really interested and willing to go to the effort of applying. We made our decisions based on a mix of their abilities, demonstrated dedication to the club, and their potential for personal growth through the leadership opportunity. It was very difficult to choose. We had 20 students apply, 10 boys and 10 girls. We were actually only planning to select 8 students, two for each session, but we ended up with 11.

Prior to selecting the leaders, we had divided up the students into the four sessions according to grade so we could accommodate differences in ability between the age groups. We changed our approach after selecting the student leaders, redistributing the groups to be a mix of classes. Our reasoning is that together with the help of the student leaders, students who are excelling will be able to support those in the group who are having a hard time, regardless of their age. We tried to pair up older and younger student leaders into the same group, as well as having mix of genders. The new session groups, leaders, and were posted as a [notice](/images/clubsetup/groups.jpg) on the school bulletin board.

| Group | Leader Name       | Grade | Gender |
|-------|-------------------|-------|--------|
| A     | Tsering Diki      | 4     | Female |
| A     | Ko sonam          | 7     | Male   |
| A     | Pema Dekyi Lama   | 9     | Female |
| B     | Dorje Sherpa      | 5     | Male   |
| B     | Pasang Tsomo      | 6     | Female |
| B     | Nima palmo        | 9     | Female |
| C     | Karma youden      | 4     | Female |
| C     | Karma Nyima       | 9     | Male   |
| D     | Pasang lhamo      | 6     | Female |
| D     | Tenzin Norbu Lama | 7     | Male   |
| D     | Tsewang Gyalzen   | 7     | Male   |

We've done one activity since selecting the Team Leaders and it went very well. On the Thursday before the activity, we met with the leaders. We reviewed what their position means, and reminded them that their job is to represent the best interests of all the club members. After explaining the new group-structure, we asked them to pay special attention to the younger kids to make sure they're understanding the material as well as the older kids and getting any extra support they may need. We also talked about how to answer questions by helping their peers reach their own conclusions, rather than just telling them the answer or immediately showing them how to do something.

The leaders really stepped up to the plate to help out their group-mates during the activity on Saturday, having already gone through it and asked questions during our Thursday preview. Their help with organizing the students and taking attendance helped things move smoothly. It was great to see the older leaders mentoring the younger leaders, and the those leaders in-turn helping out the younger students.

*	Openness in general: free to communicate with the other members.

### Makerspace in a Box

Space is a big constraint here at [SMD][] school. We get around this by using empty classrooms or the computer lab for the activities, but we still need a place to store and organize all of our parts and tools. The solution is a crude Makerspace-In-A-Box. We've managed to fit many of the goodies you'd hope to find in a Makerspace into two aluminum boxes that we can secure with padlocks and store next to our desk in the school office. Before each activity we transfer the things we need from the boxes to the classroom.

### Issues to Address Moving Forward

*	Editing and updating lessons (limited PC access, mix with hard copy revisions?)
*	Managing finances (who, how)
*	On-boarding, Team Leaders transitions (in/out), Board of Directors?
