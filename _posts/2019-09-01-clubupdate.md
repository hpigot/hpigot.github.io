In July 2019 I had the privilege of returning to SMD school in Kathmandu to check in with the Himalayan Makers Guild, one full year after leaving the club entirely in the hands of the club members. A big thank you to Vattenhallen at Lund University for supporting my visit and the club, as well as UBC Sustaingineering for their continued help covering HMG's material costs.

It was exciting to visit the club when I did, about one month after Tashi Choeden stepped down as club head and passed the responsibility on to Gyaltsen. Tashi has been involved since the start in August 2017, while Gyaltsen is the first student among the regular club members to become the club head. Using the skills he's learned through the club's activities Gyaltsen is now responsible for coordinating the activites of the club's four groups and training the student leaders who teach its 50 members. If the club continues to foster great leaders like Gyaltsen then it will be able to continue educating students at SMD for years to come.

Gyaltsen was chosen as the club head by Tashi Choeden and the student leaders according to:

- his previous engagement as a leader in the club
- his participation as a member of the club
- his grasp of the concepts taught in the activities
- his availability and interest

The club head position is filled by an SMD senior student -- one who has just graduated and is giving a year of service back to the school while developing practical skills. As such, Gyaltsen is able to focus full time on his role as club head. After his year of service, he will be followed by the next club head.

## A quick look at the club in numbers

The number of students participating in the club has remained consistent (for an overview of the groups and leadership roles, see the post [Club Structure]()):

Group, Students, Leaders, Total, July 2018
Foundation, 18, 4, 22, 
Car, 9, 3, 12, 
Solar, 8, 3, 11, 
Open, 10, 2, 13, not yet started (?)
Total, , 54, 

With an equal gender distribution among the schools students, the club now has xx% male and xx% female members (xx% and xx% respectively in July 2018). There is still an underrepresentation of female members among the student leaders: xx% now compared to xx% in 2018.

The number of weekly activites has also remained the same. A typical week is scheduled as follows:

time of day, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday*, Sunday
morning before breakfast, 
evening after dinner, 
free time,

*Saturday is the only day of the week where the student's don't have class.

At the time of my visit the usual complimentary [code club]() activities were paused due to a change in the computer labs at the school. They've now resumed under the guidance of Tashi.

## Observations and student feedback

At the end of the 2018-2019 school year (March 2019), Tashi and Gyaltsen arranged an impressive [questionaire]() to get feedback from the members. Common feedback included a desire for more confident and capable leaders who speak clearly, more variety in the activities/projects, and more programming instruction. A few key points gathered from  my discussions with Gyaltsen and a review of about 20 responses include:

The students liked:

- team work
- circuits
- learning new components
- practical activities
- project exhibitions
- and being instructed in Nepali rather than english

Changes they would like to see:

- more new electronic components
- more group work
- more comprehension checks during class
- the leaders speaking more clearly and confidently
- new activities/projects
- less repetition of the car/solar project
- more visual aids (videos)
- more shared responsibility among project group members
- more detailed instruction on programming

Skills they'd like to develop further:

- being punctual
- revising previously seen material
- working better in teams
- programming
- communication

Teaching strategies that worked well:

- videos
- hands-on activities
- being kind/personable (okay to ask questions)
- having time to do independent research
- asking questions to check student comprehension
- speaking clearly
- review concepts regularly
- use examples

Hopes for the next semester:

- learn programming in more detail
- participate in projects
- fix broken appliances (fans, lights)
- learn more about radios
- learn new simple topics
- make a simple robot
- improve leadership skills

Changes to improve the club structure:

- use more games in lessons
- speak clearly
- show documentaries, visual aids
- work in a variety of locations
- have more opportunity for creativity
- increase leader confidence 

## Observations, challenges, and changes for the coming year

I was pleased to see that both Gyaltsen had been thinking critically about the club and come up with some concrete ideas for improvment through discussions with Tashi.

- the year-to-year project schedule
- semester length
- project documentation
- division of responsibility among group leaders
- motivating members to become student leaders

After discussing them together we finalized some changes to the club which will be experimented with in the coming year.

### The year-to-year project schedule

The students are getting board with seeing the same projects every semester. The schedule currently looks like this and repeats with every 6 month semester:

[year project schedule](clubstructure/)

Students entering the car or solar project group for the first time will have seen the projects done by other students, possibly multiple times, at the semester-end exhibitions. Even though groups are encouraged to put a new twist on their projects, the underlying theme is still repeated taking some of the excitement out of it for the new students.

Starting in May 2020, we'll try a new approach. Each semester, only one of the car and solar project will occur. They will alternate semester to semester to help space out the students' exposure to them. The second project occuring each semester will be a new project previously developed by the open project groups. In these groups, the most experienced members in the club come up with a new project independently. So, the new schedule will look like this:

[new project schedule](clubstructure/)

These projects will be considerably less polished and documented than the car and solar projects. To help overcome this, students who have just completed the Foundation Group will participate in the car or solar project. The students who have already had one semester of project experience will move on to participate in the new project. A student will progress through HMG groups like this:

[example semester progression](clubstructure/)

The disadvantage to this is that students will only be exposed either the car project or the solar project, not both. They will also face
 new projects that have not been vetted like the car and solar project have been. However, with time we hope to build up a collection of reliable projects from the open project group.

### Semester length

When Tashi and I first developed the HMG activities we worked as quickly as possible to iterate through activities and organizational ideas for the club. With my limited 11-month time at the school, I wanted to make as much progress as possible in that time. This resulted in 5 month semesters, with quite ambitious 1 to 1.5 hour long weekly activities for each group.

Gyaltsen and Tashi have since observed that even advanced club members lack understanding of some key concepts, such as making circuits using a breadboard (Foundation Activity #1). Extending the semester length from 1/2 school year (5 months) to a full school year (10 months) would allow leaders to pace the activities better with more hands-on learning, review, and regular checking of student comprehension (e.g. by asking questions throughout the activities). In the project groups, it is especially noticeable with Arduino programming; the students tend to copy and use code without really understanding what it does. Gyaltsen would like to put more focus on programming. An extended semester length would allow such extra focus and regular review of key concepts.

One possible challenge with doubling the semester length is having enough hands-on activities to fill in and complement the existing curriculum. Fortunately, most of the existing activities are well suited to spending more time on, as each include extra challenges intended to occupy advanced students who complete the activity early. In addition to this, I've directed Gyaltsen to a [database of activities made available by the University of Colorado](); in particular, those using Arduinos. Another resource is a series of lesson plans recently developed by the education team at [Sustaingineering UBC]. They have kindly shared those activities with HMG and they have a lot of overlapping topics. With the extended semester HMG is well positioned to provide feedback to Sustaingineering on their new lesson plans.

The school year at SMD is full of unexpected teacher strikes and a tangled assortment of holidays from the Buddhist, Hindu, and state traditions. This can be troublesome with the club's schedule, causing the group leaders to cram in two activities into a single week to make up lost time. The extended schedule will also provide a buffer, allowing for the postponing of activities that had to be cancelled at the last minute.

Gyaltsen will start implementing this now in the current school year, with the plan to have the year-long semester firmly established by May 2020.

### project documentation

Gyaltsen found it difficult, especially in the first few weeks, to prepare for the project activities. He hadn't done the car project before, and was not sure what important points should be covered during each activity. Although there are some notes and links to helpful websites in the project documents, many details of what Tashi had done the year before were only written down in Tashi's personal notebook (which has since disappeared). To address this, the Club Head will now keep a notebook where they write their lesson notes; they may do prep work in their own notebooks, but the final guidance notes and diagrams that they use for each activity will be compiled in their Club Head notebook. The notebooks will then be passed on to each new Club Head to help guide them.

During the first Open Project group, Tashi observed that the students struggled to define and follow through with new project ideas. To address this, Gyaltsen has focused the topic down to robotics (based on feedback from a year-end survey) and is helping the students select feasible project ideas.

### division of responsibility among group leaders

Each activity group (Foundation, Car, Solar, Open) has 3-4 leaders who share the responsibility of guiding each activity. They're a mix of experienced club members and motivated new members. Dividing activity responsibility between the leaders can cause confusion; often the activity cannot be divided smoothly into parts, and the leaders have different ways of explaining things which may not be complementary. I've suggested that they try rotating responsibility activity-by-activity between each leader as an alternative approach.

### motivating students to become leaders

Being a student leader is a lot of work. The student's not only spend 1.5h of their free time running each weeks activity, they spend more than that again preparing for it. Gyaltsen suggested that we try to provide more perks for the leaders, to encourage students to continue to take on those positions. Specifically, do to field-trips to interesting tech-related places in Kathmandu such as our visit to [Karkhana Mela] early in 2018. From now on, they will plan to make at least one such visit each 1/2 year.
