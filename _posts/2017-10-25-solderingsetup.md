I recently setup 10 soldering stations for a total cost of $105 CAD to use with the [Himalayan Makers Guild](/nepal/clubsetup) in an [introductory soldering activity](/nepal/activity8). Purchasing soldering equipment here in Nepal had its advantages and disadvantages. On one hand, it cost 1/4 of what it would have if I'd purchased the parts from Amazon, but a sacrifice was made in the quality of the tools. A detailed parts list and price comparison between buying in Kathmandu or online from AliExpress or Amazon is provided in this [spreadsheet][] (or as [.xlsx][xlsx]) along with links to purchase each item.

_Note that the prices from AliExpress and Amazon do not take into consideration shipping costs._

The following items should be considered when setting up multiple soldering stations:

*	**At bare minimum,**
	*	Soldering iron
	*	Solder with a flux core
	*	Solder sponge (preferably brass)
	*	Safety glasses
	*	Multi-plug extension cord
*	**After that, the highest priority items are**
	*	Solder flux, to help the solder flow (1 shared between two stations)
	*	Soldering iron stand, for safety and convenience
*	**Related tools and nice to have items include**
	*	Desoldering pump (1 shared between two stations)
	*	Extra soldering iron tips
	*	Flush cutters (1 shared between two stations)
	*	Wire strippers (1 shared between two stations)

_Two complete soldering stations. They share solder flux, wire strippers, flush cutters, and a multi-plug extension cord. One solder sucker could also be shared between two stations. Each station includes a soldering iron, stand, sponge, solder, and safety glasses._ 

The soldering irons can easily damage table-tops, so having a heat-resistant working surface is important. Here we are fortunate to have stone counter-tops. A cheap alternative is to cut squares of [wood fibreboard][MDF] (MDF) to place under each soldering station.

If I were buying the soldering stations again, there are a couple of things things I would do differently. I would spend a bit more money to purchase [soldering irons][aa-iron] that have a power-indicator light. Power-outages are common here and the plug connections are unreliable, so having the indicator light would help the students understand if their iron is working properly. I would also purchase [brass sponges][aa-sponge] rather than wet sponges for cleaning the irons; they are more effective and last longer.
