	<p>Hi, I'm Harry Pigot and I like electronics and programming. I'm fortunate to enjoy them both in leisure and professionally. I work primarily with the design and production of medical technology, as well as education in the Maker community. In 2017 I graduated from the University of British Columbia, and I am now working in Kathmandu, Nepal, teaching programming and electronics to grade-school children. Follow what I'm up to on my <a href="/blog">blog.</a>.
