<h2>Engineer, creator, product designer</h2>
<div class="blurb">
	<p>I'm an electronics and programming enthusiast working primarily with the design and production of medical devices. After spending nearly two years working on heart and lung organ preservation technology in Sweden, I returned to the University of British Columbia to finish my degree in Electrical Engineering. In August 2017 moved to Kathmandu, Nepal, where I am teaching programming and electronics to grade-school children for one year. Follow what I'm up to on my <a href="/nepalblog">blog.</a>.
